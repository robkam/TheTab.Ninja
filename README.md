# TheTab.Ninja

**TheTab.Ninja** by [kodar.ninja](https://kodar.ninja/) is an open-source browser extension that transforms your new tab into a fully customizable launch page. Manage your bookmarks and open tabs effortlessly while keeping your data private by syncing through your own GitHub repository—no external servers required.

## Features

- **Custom New Tab Page:** Replace your default new tab with a personalized dashboard.
- **Bookmark & Tab Management:** Organize your bookmarks and drag & drop your open tabs with ease.
- **GitHub Sync:** Securely sync your data using your own GitHub repository.
- **Data Import/Export:** Easily import collections from Toby and export your settings for backup or sharing.
- **Collaboration:** Share repositories with friends or colleagues for seamless collaboration.
- **Search & Files Function:** Quickly filter your collections and bookmarks to find exactly what you need.

## Search & Files Function

TheTab.Ninja comes with a powerful search feature designed to help you quickly locate the content you need:

1. **Search Field:** At the top of your new tab page, you’ll find a search field that filters content in real time as you type.
2. **Search Collections:** Type a `#` followed by a keyword to filter only your collections. For example:  
   `#work` will display all collections that include “work” in their name.
3. **Search Bookmarks:** Simply enter a keyword without any prefix to filter bookmarks within each collection. This allows you to quickly locate specific bookmarks across your collections.
4. **Global Search:** Type a `%` followed by a keyword to search through both collections and bookmarks. For example:  
   `%project` will highlight all items containing “project.”
5. **Multiple Keywords:** Use the pipe symbol (`|`) to separate multiple search terms and perform an OR-search. For example:  
   `#blue|red` shows collections with either “blue” or “red” in the name.
6. **File Filtering:** If you manage files (via import/export), you can also search for filenames and content using the same search field.

These tools allow you to efficiently navigate through large amounts of data to find exactly what you need.
